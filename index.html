    <p class="about">
      Hi, I'm Declan, welcome to my website! I am currently studying Data Science as an undergraduate at 
      the University of California, San Diego. I'm a big fan of science fiction and LEGO, as well as programming 
      and cooking.
      <br><br> 
      I'm a Data Science Instructional Assistant at UCSD and a member of the executive board for
      <a href="https://medium.com/ds3ucsd" target="_blank">DS3</a>, our Data Science Student Society. 
      I am also a part of <a href="http://tc.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Triton Software Engineering</a> 
      as a developer and Associated Students as a Judicial Board Member.
