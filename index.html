  <p class="about">
    Hi, I'm Declan, welcome to my website! I am currently an undergraduate studying Data Science at 
    the University of California, San Diego. I'm a big fan of science fiction and LEGO, as well as programming 
    and adventuring.
    <br><br> 
    I'm a data science tutor at UCSD and a member of <a href="http://ds3.io/" target="_blank">DS3</a>, our Data 
    Science Student Society. I am a part of Associated Students as a Judicial Board Member and a staff writer for 
    the <a href="https://themq.org/" target="_blank">Muir Quarterly</a>.
