    <p class="about">
      Hi, I'm Declan, welcome to my website! I am currently an undergraduate studying Data Science at 
      the University of California, San Diego. I'm a big fan of science fiction and LEGO, as well as programming 
      and adventuring.
      <br><br> 
      I'm a data science tutor at UCSD and a member of <a href="http://ds3.io/" target="_blank">DS3</a>, our Data 
      Science Student Society. I am also a part of Associated Students as a Judicial Board Member and a staff writer for
