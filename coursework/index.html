          This introductory course develops computational thinking and tools necessary to answer questions that 
          arise from large-scale datasets. This course emphasizes an end-to-end approach to data science, introducing 
          programming techniques in Python that cover data processing, modeling, and analysis.

          Provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, algorithms, and languages used in 
          data science by expanding the repertoire of computational concepts introduced in DSC 10 and exposing students 
          to techniques of abstraction. Course will be taught in Python and will cover topics including recursion, 
          higher-order functions, function composition, object-oriented programming, interpreters, classes and simple 
          data structures such as arrays, lists and linked lists.
