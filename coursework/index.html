          This introductory course develops computational thinking and tools necessary to answer questions that 
          arise from large-scale datasets. This course emphasizes an end-to-end approach to data science, introducing 
          programming techniques in Python that cover data processing, modeling, and analysis.

        <li>
          Provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, algorithms, and languages used in 
          data science by expanding the repertoire of computational concepts introduced in DSC 10 and exposing students 
          to techniques of abstraction. Course will be taught in Python and will cover topics including recursion, 
          higher-order functions, function composition, object-oriented programming, interpreters, classes and simple 
          data structures such as arrays, lists and linked lists.

        <li>
            Builds on topics covered in DSC 20 and provides practical experience in composing larger computational systems 
            through several significant programming projects using Java.  Students will study advanced programming 
            techniques including encapsulation, abstract data types, interfaces, algorithms and complexity, and data 
            structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, heaps, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees 
            and hash tables.

          An accelerated introduction to computer science and programming using the Java language. Basic UNIX. 
          Modularity and abstraction. Documentation, testing and verification techniques. Basic object-oriented 
          programming, including inheritance and dynamic binding. Exception handling. Event-driven programming.

        <li>
            Basic discrete mathematical structures: sets, relations, functions, sequences, equivalence relations, 
            partial orders, and number systems. Methods of reasoning and proofs: prepositional logic, predicate logic, 
            induction, recursion, and pigeonhole principle. Infinite sets and diagonalization. Basic counting techniques; 
            permutation and combinations. Applications will be given to digital logic design, elementary number theory,
