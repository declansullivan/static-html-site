        <h2>Lars Homestead - 6/23/18</h2>
        <p>
          The end goal of my father and my trip to Tunisia was to visit the film site for the Lars Homestead exterior 
          shots.  We managed to make it there after driving across desert and salt flats from one side of Tunisia to 
          the other.  When we got there we took a bunch of photos and watched the sunset just as Luke did.  It was a 
          fantastic experience and I would encourage anyone considering to make the Star Wars pilgrimage themselves to try 
          it out.

        <h2>Hotel Sidi Driss - 6/23/18</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the summer of 2018 my father and I went on a trip to Tunisia to visit Star Wars filming 
          locations. One stop along the way was the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata. This was where the interior shots of the 
          Lars Homestead were filmed. It was great to see a little mock vaporator there, as well as hang out where Luke, 
          Uncle Owen, and Aunt Beru all ate together when Luke complains about having to stay on for another season.
