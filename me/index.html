        <h2>Hotel Sidi Driss - 6/23/18</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the summer of 2018 my father and I went on a trip to Tunisia to visit Star Wars filming 
          locations. One stop along the way was the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata. This was where the interior shots of the 
          Lars Homestead were filmed. It was great to see a little mock vaporator there, as well as hang out where Luke, 
          Uncle Owen, and Aunt Beru all ate together when Luke complains about having to stay on for another season.
