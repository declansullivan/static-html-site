Marvel Studios is celebrating its 10th year anniversary, and for it they have partnered with IMAX to bring every single one 
of the movies in the MCU back to theaters over the course of a week. The movies are in IMAX 3D and $7 each, and I saw my first 
one just today: Iron Man 3. 

I love Iron Man 3. Well, all of the Iron Man films, but definitely Iron Man 3. The Mark 42 is such a satisfying suit to watch 
in action, and Tony Stark does a great job at proving the point he makes to Peter Parker in Spiderman: Homecoming, that if you're 
nothing without a suit, then you shouldn't have it. 

The film is an absolute blast from the House Party Protocol at the final battle, to the brilliant score composed by Brian Tyler
which finally gives Tony Stark a memorable theme. The Mark 42 suit up sequences are also wholly enjoyable, from the initial test
of the suit to the long distance flight from Tennessee to Miami.

Iron Man 3 is a genuinely fun film and a proper closing point for the Iron Man trilogy. Personally, I also see it as one of 
those films that can disappoint you as you leave the theater, not because of how the movie was, but because you are no longer
in the world that the movie presented. I love Iron Man 3, I love Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see how he appears in Avengers 4.
